# KNN-on-Ionosphere-data
Classification task on ionosphere data using a K-Nearest Neighbors algortihm

The dataset in use is called Ionosphere (downloaded from UCL machine learning), which is the recording of many high-frequency antennas. The aim of the antennas is to determine whether there is a structure in the ionosphere and a region in the upper atmosphere. Those that have a structure are deemed good, while those that do not are deemed bad. The aim of this application is to build a simple data mining classifier, based on the K- nearest neighbors algorithm, that can determine whether an image is good or bad.

During the applications I will show a classic and very simple task of data ming for make classification on new unseen data :). 

if you follow the code step by step is very simple to undestand.

At the end I used the Pipeline routine of scikitlearn for illustrate how is simple to implement a pipeline workflow of ML in python using scikitlearn
